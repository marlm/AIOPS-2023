Change activity, as referenced on the individual tasks, occurring within an IPL/maintenance window must be evaluated on a change by change basis to determine if the activity impacted the IPL. The activity causing the problem would be backed out as outlined in the backout plan for its change management CR. If problems are encountered during an IPL due to an IPL AFFECTING STS, the STS would be backed out according to standard guidelines and STS documentation.

2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):

To manage activity for the maintenance window and when there is no change activity for the window to perform a therapeutic IPL of the systems.  Any actual change activity for the window will have its own change requests stating its purpose and negative impact. 

The work within this window is required so the performance of the systems will not become degraded and current releases of system software can be applied.

3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?

Change activity for the systems will not be coordinated and will potentially have conflicts resulting in outages. 

If the work within this window is not performed the performance of the systems will become degraded and current releases of system software will not be applied.

2.	Now start CA11. 
A.	S CAL7,SUB=JES2 
3.	Move CA 7 VTAM Node: 
1.	Bring down the major node in the primary system, using the command. 
A.	V NET,INACT,ID=E1CA7 – where XX is the two character net id for the primary system, in our example E1. Enter command on E2SY lpar
2.	Now, bring up the major node in the secondary system, using the command:
A.	V NET,ACT,ID=E1CA7 - where XX is the two character net id for the primary system, in our example E1. Enter command on E1SY lpar

List the ""Backout Steps"" OR you may provide a ""High Level Summary"" here IF a Backout Plan is attached to the Assessment Tab or details are documented on the Tasks tab:

The backout plan for an IPL is to re-IPL. These procedures are located on the ROCC Sharepoint at https://att.sharepoint.com/sites/EPASMF-EMOC-IBMMO/EMOC/Procedures/Forms/AllItems.aspx.  

Change activity, as referenced on the individual tasks, occurring within an IPL/maintenance window must be evaluated on a change by change basis to determine if the activity impacted the IPL. The activity causing the problem would be backed out as outlined in the backout plan for its change management CR. If problems are encountered during an IPL due to an IPL AFFECTING STS, the STS would be backed out according to standard guidelines and STS documentation.

If assistance is required to diagnose a problem, appropriate parties should be notified.

2. List the ""Backout Validation Steps"" OR provide a ""High Level Summary"" here IF a Detailed Backout Plan is attached to the Assessment Tab or details are documented on the Tasks tab:

Validation for the IPL/maintenance window itself is performed via checkout as part of the ROCC's procedures after an IPL or non-IPL maintenance window.  ROCC is to determine that the system has successfully initialized, and users can logon.

Validation for any changes within the window will be a part of that change's CR.

Systems with Non-IPL maintenance: E1SY:E2SY:H1SY:H2SY:I1SY:I3SY


2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):

To manage activity for the maintenance window and when there is no change activity for the window to perform a therapeutic IPL of the systems.  Any actual change activity for the window will have its own change requests stating its purpose and negative impact. 

The work within this window is required so the performance of the systems will not become degraded and current releases of system software can be applied.

3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?

Change activity for the systems will not be coordinated and will potentially have conflicts resulting in outages. 

If the work within this window is not performed the performance of the systems will become degraded and current releases of system software will not be applied.

List the ""Backout Steps"" OR you may provide a ""High Level Summary"" here IF a Backout Plan is attached to the Assessment Tab or details are documented on the Tasks tab:

The backout plan for an IPL is to re-IPL. These procedures are located on the ROCC Sharepoint at https://att.sharepoint.com/sites/EPASMF-EMOC-IBMMO/EMOC/Procedures/Forms/AllItems.aspx.  

Change activity, as referenced on the individual tasks, occurring within an IPL/maintenance window must be evaluated on a change by change basis to determine if the activity impacted the IPL. The activity causing the problem would be backed out as outlined in the backout plan for its change management CR. If problems are encountered during an IPL due to an IPL AFFECTING STS, the STS would be backed out according to standard guidelines and STS documentation.

If assistance is required to diagnose a problem, appropriate parties should be notified.

2. List the ""Backout Validation Steps"" OR provide a ""High Level Summary"" here IF a Detailed Backout Plan is attached to the Assessment Tab or details are documented on the Tasks tab:

Validation for the IPL/maintenance window itself is performed via checkout as part of the ROCC's procedures after an IPL or non-IPL maintenance window.  ROCC is to determine that the system has successfully initialized, and users can logon.

Validation for any changes within the window will be a part of that change's CR.

2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):

To manage activity for the maintenance window and when there is no change activity for the window to perform a therapeutic IPL of the systems.  Any actual change activity for the window will have its own change requests stating its purpose and negative impact. 

The work within this window is required so the performance of the systems will not become degraded and current releases of system software can be applied.

3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?

Change activity for the systems will not be coordinated and will potentially have conflicts resulting in outages. 

If the work within this window is not performed the performance of the systems will become degraded and current releases of system software will not be applied.

Change activity, as referenced on the individual tasks, occurring within an IPL/maintenance window must be evaluated on a change by change basis to determine if the activity impacted the IPL. The activity causing the problem would be backed out as outlined in the backout plan for its change management CR. If problems are encountered during an IPL due to an IPL AFFECTING STS, the STS would be backed out according to standard guidelines and STS documentation.

2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):

To manage activity for the maintenance window and when there is no change activity for the window to perform a therapeutic IPL of the systems.  Any actual change activity for the window will have its own change requests stating its purpose and negative impact. 

The work within this window is required so the performance of the systems will not become degraded and current releases of system software can be applied.

3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?

Change activity for the systems will not be coordinated and will potentially have conflicts resulting in outages. 

If the work within this window is not performed the performance of the systems will become degraded and current releases of system software will not be applied.

2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):

To manage activity for the maintenance window and when there is no change activity for the window to perform a therapeutic IPL of the systems.  Any actual change activity for the window will have its own change requests stating its purpose and negative impact. 

The work within this window is required so the performance of the systems will not become degraded and current releases of system software can be applied.


3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?

Change activity for the systems will not be coordinated and will potentially have conflicts resulting in outages. 

If the work within this window is not performed the performance of the systems will become degraded and current releases of system software will not be applied.

The backout plan for an IPL is to re-IPL. These procedures are located on the ROCC Sharepoint at https://att.sharepoint.com/sites/EPASMF-EMOC-IBMMO/EMOC/Procedures/Forms/AllItems.aspx.  

Change activity, as referenced on the individual tasks, occurring within an IPL/maintenance window must be evaluated on a change by change basis to determine if the activity impacted the IPL. The activity causing the problem would be backed out as outlined in the backout plan for its change management CR. If problems are encountered during an IPL due to an IPL AFFECTING STS, the STS would be backed out according to standard guidelines and STS documentation.

2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):

To manage activity for the maintenance window and when there is no change activity for the window to perform a therapeutic IPL of the systems.  Any actual change activity for the window will have its own change requests stating its purpose and negative impact. 

The work within this window is required so the performance of the systems will not become degraded and current releases of system software can be applied.

3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?

Change activity for the systems will not be coordinated and will potentially have conflicts resulting in outages. 

If the work within this window is not performed the performance of the systems will become degraded and current releases of system software will not be applied.

List the ""Backout Steps"" OR you may provide a ""High Level Summary"" here IF a Backout Plan is attached to the Assessment Tab or details are documented on the Tasks tab:

The backout plan for an IPL is to re-IPL. These procedures are located on the ROCC Sharepoint at https://att.sharepoint.com/sites/EPASMF-EMOC-IBMMO/EMOC/Procedures/Forms/AllItems.aspx.  

Change activity, as referenced on the individual tasks, occurring within an IPL/maintenance window must be evaluated on a change by change basis to determine if the activity impacted the IPL. The activity causing the problem would be backed out as outlined in the backout plan for its change management CR. If problems are encountered during an IPL due to an IPL AFFECTING STS, the STS would be backed out according to standard guidelines and STS documentation.

2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):

To manage activity for the maintenance window and when there is no change activity for the window to perform a therapeutic IPL of the systems.  Any actual change activity for the window will have its own change requests stating its purpose and negative impact. 

The work within this window is required so the performance of the systems will not become degraded and current releases of system software can be applied.

3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?

Change activity for the systems will not be coordinated and will potentially have conflicts resulting in outages.

2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):

To manage activity for the maintenance window and when there is no change activity for the window to perform a therapeutic IPL of the systems.  Any actual change activity for the window will have its own change requests stating its purpose and negative impact. 

The work within this window is required so the performance of the systems will not become degraded and current releases of system software can be applied.

3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?

Change activity for the systems will not be coordinated and will potentially have conflicts resulting in outages. 

If the work within this window is not performed the performance of the systems will become degraded and current releases of system software will not be applied.

2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):

To manage activity for the maintenance window and when there is no change activity for the window to perform a therapeutic IPL of the systems.  Any actual change activity for the window will have its own change requests stating its purpose and negative impact. 

The work within this window is required so the performance of the systems will not become degraded and current releases of system software can be applied.


3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?

Change activity for the systems will not be coordinated and will potentially have conflicts resulting in outages. 

If the work within this window is not performed the performance of the systems will become degraded and current releases of system software will not be applied.

1.  Brief Description of Change (WHAT is being done): Teradata will apply the latest cert list upgrade (17.10.03.22 DBMS/PDE), and also apply recommended MVS configuration changes.

2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):  The patch upgrade will pick up fixes, enhancements, and security updates. The MVS configuration changes are being made per Teradata's recommendation to improve mainframe to database connectivity. Test jobs from a Dallas LPAR (FTS1) to St. Louis Intellicloud (SL1TD01) are taking much longer to complete than the jobs running via channel direct connection from the LPAR to the Dallas Teradata system (DA03). The changes being made should improve job completion times.

3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?  The system will be susceptible to security vulnerabilites and outstanding issues. MVS connectivity is not working at its full potential with the current configuration. In addition, the ATTDA03 (GOV Prod) to St. Louis Intellicloud (SL1TD01) migration will have to be rescheduled if we cannot improve the job completion rates.

2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):

To manage activity for the maintenance window and when there is no change activity for the window to perform a therapeutic IPL of the systems.  Any actual change activity for the window will have its own change requests stating its purpose and negative impact. 

The work within this window is required so the performance of the systems will not become degraded and current releases of system software can be applied.

3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?

Change activity for the systems will not be coordinated and will potentially have conflicts resulting in outages. 

If the work within this window is not performed the performance of the systems will become degraded and current releases of system software will not be applied.

Systems with Non-IPL maintenance: B2SY:D2SY:G2SY:G4SY:S2SY


2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):

To manage activity for the maintenance window and when there is no change activity for the window to perform a therapeutic IPL of the systems.  Any actual change activity for the window will have its own change requests stating its purpose and negative impact. 

The work within this window is required so the performance of the systems will not become degraded and current releases of system software can be applied.

3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?

Change activity for the systems will not be coordinated and will potentially have conflicts resulting in outages. 

If the work within this window is not performed the performance of the systems will become degraded and current releases of system software will not be applied.

Change activity, as referenced on the individual tasks, occurring within an IPL/maintenance window must be evaluated on a change by change basis to determine if the activity impacted the IPL. The activity causing the problem would be backed out as outlined in the backout plan for its change management CR. If problems are encountered during an IPL due to an IPL AFFECTING STS, the STS would be backed out according to standard guidelines and STS documentation.

2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):

To manage activity for the maintenance window and when there is no change activity for the window to perform a therapeutic IPL of the systems.  Any actual change activity for the window will have its own change requests stating its purpose and negative impact. 

The work within this window is required so the performance of the systems will not become degraded and current releases of system software can be applied.

3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?

Change activity for the systems will not be coordinated and will potentially have conflicts resulting in outages. 

If the work within this window is not performed the performance of the systems will become degraded and current releases of system software will not be applied.

1.  Brief Description of Change (WHAT is being done): Teradata will apply config changes to improve network mainframe (TCP/IP) connectivity.

2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed): Test jobs from a Dallas LPAR (FTS1) to St. Louis Intellicloud (SL1TD01) are taking much longer to complete than the jobs running via channel direct connection from the LPAR to the Dallas Teradata system (DA03). The changes being made should improve job completion times. Prior to making the changes on the Prod system, we need to apply the changes to the Dev environment (SL1TD02).

3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented? The ATTDA03 (GOV Prod) to St. Louis Intellicloud (SL1TD01) migration will have to be rescheduled if we cannot improve the job completion rates.

1.  Brief Description of Change (WHAT is being done): Teradata will upgrade the TCHN software to 17.10.03.28 and install PDE package 17.10.03.31.

2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):  The TCHN software upgrade is to address a known issue. The PDE upgrade is being done to pick up DR 197986 and DR 198033 for Node Panic diagnostics.

3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented? If the TCHN software isn't upgraded, we will continue to be at risk of a highly disruptive problem identified by Teradata MVS support. If the PDE patch isn't applied to the Dev environment, we cannot apply it to Production. The Birmingham Production database (BH1TD01) has encountered 4 unplanned restarts that currently have no root cause. Teradata would like to apply the DRs to gather more info if we have additional unplanned restarts.

This update is part of a standardization and RECON files cleanup effort, to have this applications databases set to standard values across all IMS regions as there's a lot of inconsistencies in naming conventions, missing ICs for certain databases, as well as plenty of them not being included in RECON. We will be updating all 8 regions to include the remaining databases in DBRC.

The standardization of these parameters would not be achieved which can lead to several delays in troubleshooting database related issues in production as well as during the disaster recovery exercise since there are too many unnecessary differences between the regions.

     BP01 of August will go into loop again Also, some error accounts are present in BP25 which are not 
     creating offset record in MUNISFE file of CQ301. So, fix need to be deployed before the BP25 of 
     July.

The backout plan for an IPL is to re-IPL. These procedures are located on the ROCC Sharepoint at https://att.sharepoint.com/sites/EPASMF-EMOC-IBMMO/EMOC/Procedures/Forms/AllItems.aspx.  

Change activity, as referenced on the individual tasks, occurring within an IPL/maintenance window must be evaluated on a change by change basis to determine if the activity impacted the IPL. The activity causing the problem would be backed out as outlined in the backout plan for its change management CR. If problems are encountered during an IPL due to an IPL AFFECTING STS, the STS would be backed out according to standard guidelines and STS documentation.

Systems with Non-IPL maintenance: A6SY:K1SY:L1SY:M1SY:O1SY:O2SY:T3SY


2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):

To manage activity for the maintenance window and when there is no change activity for the window to perform a therapeutic IPL of the systems.  Any actual change activity for the window will have its own change requests stating its purpose and negative impact. 

The work within this window is required so the performance of the systems will not become degraded and current releases of system software can be applied.

3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?

Change activity for the systems will not be coordinated and will potentially have conflicts resulting in outages. 

If the work within this window is not performed the performance of the systems will become degraded and current releases of system software will not be applied.

Change activity, as referenced on the individual tasks, occurring within an IPL/maintenance window must be evaluated on a change by change basis to determine if the activity impacted the IPL. The activity causing the problem would be backed out as outlined in the backout plan for its change management CR.

2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):

To manage activity for the maintenance window and when there is no change activity for the window to perform a therapeutic IPL of the systems.  Any actual change activity for the window will have its own change requests stating its purpose and negative impact. 

The work within this window is required so the performance of the systems will not become degraded and current releases of system software can be applied.


3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?

Change activity for the systems will not be coordinated and will potentially have conflicts resulting in outages. 

If the work within this window is not performed the performance of the systems will become degraded and current releases of system software will not be applied.

To manage activity for the maintenance window and when there is no change activity for the window to perform a therapeutic IPL of the systems.  Any actual change activity for the window will have its own change requests stating its purpose and negative impact. 

The work within this window is required so the performance of the systems will not become degraded and current releases of system software can be applied.


3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?

Change activity for the systems will not be coordinated and will potentially have conflicts resulting in outages. 

If the work within this window is not performed the performance of the systems will become degraded and current releases of system software will not be applied.

Change activity, as referenced on the individual tasks, occurring within an IPL/maintenance window must be evaluated on a change by change basis to determine if the activity impacted the IPL. The activity causing the problem would be backed out as outlined in the backout plan for its change management CR. If problems are encountered during an IPL due to an IPL AFFECTING STS, the STS would be backed out according to standard guidelines and STS documentation.

2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):

To manage activity for the maintenance window and when there is no change activity for the window to perform a therapeutic IPL of the systems.  Any actual change activity for the window will have its own change requests stating its purpose and negative impact. 

The work within this window is required so the performance of the systems will not become degraded and current releases of system software can be applied.

3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?

Change activity for the systems will not be coordinated and will potentially have conflicts resulting in outages. 

If the work within this window is not performed the performance of the systems will become degraded and current releases of system software will not be applied.

This Message Is From an External Sender 
This message came from outside your organization. 


CMCC Team

This email is to notify you that as part of a code improvement process, CTM has shipped a GENTRAN for CTM External facing modules via CHGMAN.
The MR# for this shipment is IP3.255001.

The Promotion to the upmost GENTRAN level 90 on ALT3 is successfully completed and you will receive a shipment with GENTRAN control information along with the software components via CHGMAN.

Technically, these components are not used by anyone on MESA3 and Alph 3 but I would like you to do the processing that CMCC does on these components as BAU. If you need any further information on these, please let me know and we can coordinate.

These processes are not so frequent and the last time we did this was sometime on 09/2022. So if there is any roadblock on the process, we can fix it.

The final production deployment is planned on 09/15 (coming Friday).

List the ""Backout Steps"" OR you may provide a ""High Level Summary"" here IF a Backout Plan is attached to the Assessment Tab or details are documented on the Tasks tab:

The backout plan for an IPL is to re-IPL. These procedures are located on the ROCC Sharepoint at https://att.sharepoint.com/sites/EPASMF-EMOC-IBMMO/EMOC/Procedures/Forms/AllItems.aspx.  

Change activity, as referenced on the individual tasks, occurring within an IPL/maintenance window must be evaluated on a change by change basis to determine if the activity impacted the IPL. The activity causing the problem would be backed out as outlined in the backout plan for its change management CR. If problems are encountered during an IPL due to an IPL AFFECTING STS, the STS would be backed out according to standard guidelines and STS documentation.

If assistance is required to diagnose a problem, appropriate parties should be notified.

2. List the ""Backout Validation Steps"" OR provide a ""High Level Summary"" here IF a Detailed Backout Plan is attached to the Assessment Tab or details are documented on the Tasks tab:

Validation for the IPL/maintenance window itself is performed via checkout as part of the ROCC's procedures after an IPL or non-IPL maintenance window.  ROCC is to determine that the system has successfully initialized, and users can logon.

Validation for any changes within the window will be a part of that change's CR.

Systems with Non-IPL maintenance: E1SY:E2SY:H1SY:H2SY:I1SY:I3SY


2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):

To manage activity for the maintenance window and when there is no change activity for the window to perform a therapeutic IPL of the systems.  Any actual change activity for the window will have its own change requests stating its purpose and negative impact. 

The work within this window is required so the performance of the systems will not become degraded and current releases of system software can be applied.

3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?

Change activity for the systems will not be coordinated and will potentially have conflicts resulting in outages. 

If the work within this window is not performed the performance of the systems will become degraded and current releases of system software will not be applied.

1.  Brief Description of Change (WHAT is being done): 

DB2 UTS conversions in October 2023
There are some DB2 UTS changes planned for October that you should be aware of.
DB2 systems support has turned on new DB2 functionality (function level 509) in production that will prevent the creation of non-Universal tables and tablespaces. This was done on all production systems.
The Kyndryl MO DBA team will begin the conversion of non-UTS DB2 tablespaces in all test DB2 subsystems starting in October.

2.  Business Reason (WHY is this change being performed):

Improvement and upgrade.

DB2 Object Standards
DB2 has different types of tablespaces but is moving to universal tablespaces (UTS). All other tablespace types are deprecated which means they will go away in the future. There are many different types of DB2 TS such as simple and segmented.
These DB2 guidelines focus on the normal parameters used in a DB2 UTS definition. Please follow these guidelines when creating new DB2 TS/TB/IX.

3.  What will be the negative Impact to the business if the Change is Not Implemented?
Improvement and upgrade not implemented.
